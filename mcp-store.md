# UI Implementation Plan for Todos Application

## 1. Core UI Structure
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The app is a focused SPA with all functionality on a single main page.
- **Main Components:**
  - **Top Bar**: Contains dark/light mode toggle.
  - **Title/Header**: Prominent app title.
  - **Add Todo Form**: Input and button to add new todos.
  - **Todo List**: List of todos, each with:
    - Checkbox to toggle completion
    - Title (editable inline)
    - Delete button (opens confirmation modal)
  - **Edit Mode**: Inline textarea for editing todo title, with save/cancel actions.
  - **Delete Confirmation Modal**: Modal dialog for confirming deletion.
  - **Error/Loading States**: Clear feedback for loading and error conditions.

## 2. Theming & Visual Style
- **Modern, Clean Design**: Use clear, simple surfaces and subtle shadows for cards, buttons, and inputs.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Full support for both, with persistent user preference (localStorage).
- **Consistent Spacing & Sizing**: Use of padding, margin, and max-width for a clean, centered layout.
- **Typography**: Modern, readable fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif).
- **Color Palette**:
  - Light: Whites, light grays, subtle shadows
  - Dark: Deep grays, black, white text, subtle dark shadows
- **Button Styles**: Clear affordances for primary, confirm, cancel, and delete actions.

## 3. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (inputs, buttons, modals) should be accessible via keyboard.
- **ARIA Labels**: Use descriptive aria-labels for buttons and modals.
- **Focus Management**: Auto-focus on modals and edit fields; return focus on close.
- **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly, with flexible widths and touch-friendly controls.

## 4. Iconography & Branding
- **Flat, Simple Icons**: Use flat, proportionate, straight-line icons (no curves, no round forms) for check, refresh, and delete actions.
- **App Icons**: Provide all required favicon and PWA icons (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch, etc.)
- **Branding**: App title and icons should be consistent and recognizable.

## 5. Opportunities for Next-Level Enhancements
- **Componentization**: Refactor UI into reusable components (e.g., TodoItem, Modal, Toggle, Button).
- **Animations**: Add subtle transitions for adding, editing, and deleting todos.
- **Empty State**: Friendly message or illustration when there are no todos.
- **Bulk Actions**: Support for bulk complete/delete.
- **Filters/Sorting**: Allow filtering by completed/active and sorting by date/title.
- **User Feedback**: Toasts or snackbars for actions (add, edit, delete, error).
- **Settings Panel**: For theme, accessibility, and app preferences.
- **PWA Enhancements**: Improve manifest, offline support, and installability.
- **Testing**: Expand UI and E2E tests for all flows and edge cases.
